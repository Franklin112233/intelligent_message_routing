# Suspected Fraud Guidance

- If a customer suspects unauthorised activity, immediately: 
  1) Freeze the card or relevant channel; 
  2) Advise customer to change credentials; 
  3) Begin fraud investigation and confirm recent activity; 
  4) Provide timescales (typically 7–10 business days) and next steps.
- Never request full card number, PIN, or full password via message.
- If social‑engineering suspected, share safety tips and report internally.
